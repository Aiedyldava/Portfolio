# Hand Gesture Recognition

## Objective
I make this project for my thesis to play games without keyboard or controller, just making hand gesture to control it. 

## Methods
I'm using Tensorflow Lite Machine Learning 

## Kind of gesture
1. Up
2. Up Right
3. Right
4. Down Right
5. Down
6. Down Left
7. Left
8. Up Left
9. Pause

I'm using excel sheets for storing the training models that I take inside the app.
To take the data, press 'k' keys and press number from 0-9 to take the different kind of gesture to be traained.
Now, there are only 900 training data and will increase over the time.
